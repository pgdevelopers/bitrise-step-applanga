      description: |
        By default values only get pushed if they aren't existing already on the dashboard to make sure not to accidentally overwrite translations. 
        If you want to push local changed files you can do so with the `--force option`. 
        But be cautious that this might overwrite values set by a translator on the dashboard, so be sure to pull before you push.
